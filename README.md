# employee-tracker
For this project, I created a command-line application that accepts user input to generate tables of employee data. This application is run in the user's terminal and requires use of Node.js, Inquirer, console.table, and MySQL.  Using the inquirer package, at start, the user is presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role.

## Using this application
To use this Employee Tracker, the user will clone this github repository to their device.  Next they will use their terminal to open the folder and will login with the command line prompt: mysql -u root -p; enter password; then source schema.sql. Next, run "node server.js" to execute the tracker prompts.  The tracker will require the user to answer prompt questions, right in their terminal/command line, then will populate and display the tables, based on employee input.  See the demo video below for an example of usage.
